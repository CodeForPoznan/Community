# Organizing Hacknight
 
1. We try to be on time (meeting starts at 5 PM and ends around 10 PM).
1. In the beginning we enlist topics and tasks that we're going to do and try to establish the timeframe for doing them.
1. One person in the group stays in the loop and follows all the projects and tasks, taking care of the group and the meeting flow.
1. If we have the subject that does not need to include everyone in it, we work in sub-groups then, scattered in different spaces in order to not to disturb each other.
1. At the end of the meeting we gather and talk about what we have planned, what we have done and what are going to do on the next week.
1. Once in a month we plan activities and find out the stage of the project (refinement and planning).
1. Onboarding takes place parallely in the seprate space/place.
