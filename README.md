# Structure of files

Currently we have two folders - first for organization stuff, second for technical tutorials. 

If you are new here, please start with reading `getting_to_know_us.md` within `organization_onboarding` folder.

If you need any assistance with technical stuff like Github flow or Docker installation, go to `technical_onboarding` folder. 

# Naming of the files

We have agreed to stick with naming of the files in the following format: `name_of_your_file`.
